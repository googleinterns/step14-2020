Team Titans's Capstone Project (Google STEP 2020)

Camaraderie is a messaging platform that facilitates diverse engagements and community building. 
As remote interns during quarantine, we found it harder to build our network and meet new people. Although there are existing chat rooms, those chat rooms are too elusive or are too populated, stiffening meaningful conversations.
Thus our idea was born: Camaraderie. 
Camaraderie is a message app that places you automatically into multiple chats based on the interests or traits you provided when signing up. 
Those tags can range from location to hobby to whatever you can think of. We hope to build a meaningful and friendly platform to connect Googlers with shared traits to spark fun conversations and build meaningful connections.
